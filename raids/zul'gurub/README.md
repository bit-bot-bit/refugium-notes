## ZG Notes

* To get to Hakkar you have to down all high priests there are 5 in all and four additional optional bosses.
* First boss to down is high priestess Jelik (Batgirl) to the southwest.
* On your way be wary of Gurubashi bat riders, they explode when they die so melee must back off when they are low.


## High Priestess Jelik:
* Tank the boss where she spawns and have ranged/casters stay about max range to avoid silence. (Lasts 10sec)
* Make sure boss is faced away from melee/casters so no one gets hit by her swoop  ability.
* Waves of bats will spawn during the fight and will need aoe down do not let them get to casters, they might need to be picked up by an off tank.
* Heep a hunter relatively close to her off to the side of melee opposite of caster side or in between melee and casters to absorb her charge and aoe silence. (this may require a heal assign to that hunter)
* She will cast Shadow word pain that will need to be dispelled and a heal + a chain mind flay in priest form that will need interruption. Also she has an aoe fear (tremor totes ma gotes baby!). Bats will periodically drop fire during this phase so… don’t stand in it.
* On your way to the next boss careful of Axe throwers they have a nasty spin so be ready to heal the tank hard and all melee need to jump off for duration (unless heals can deal with it or if you’re Moonta… HEAL MOONTA!!) you can also polymorph them to cancel it (spin lasts 10sec).
* Kill all snakes in the room be Venoxis and then you can go snake skinning baby.


## High Priest Venoxis
* This fight will require an off tank to pull snakes off raid and get aoe’d by dps and Venoxis must be pulled away from everyone else because he’ll cast a holy nova and its not healing us plus a pseudo chain lightning spell ( please have melee stay far away until phase change). Pull him to a place where he can be kited around the room for the next phase.
* Tank will kite Venoxis around outside as he farts (Stay out of farts).
* Make your way north and clear out everything in the spider room and you can fight the next priest.


## High Priestess Mar’li
* Tank away from ranged dps/heals. Have shammies drop poison cleanse totems while in troll phase and cleanse poison also interrupt her drain life spell. Also, spiders adds will spawn and need to be AoE’d down (these are top prio as they get stronger as they are alive).
* Before she switches phases make sure there is an off tank with ranged as she roots everyone in melee, drops aggro and will go straight for ranged.
* On your way to the boss in the southeast beware of gurubashi blood drinkers they suck life from all players mobs around them. Tank them away from it all and have ranged focus these twilight fanfics down. Careful of champions as well as they have a hardcore knock back and will toss you into a nice mob that’ll end the raid.


## BloodLord Mando’kir (Optional)
* You can tank him where he is and OT raptor and then just burn Brarlin Mando down. (Raptor has a sunder tho careful. You can kill the raptor but this will buff Mando)
* Watch for threatning gaze, whoever has it has to stop EVERYTHING!!
* Also have a hunter far away from grp to soak up the charge (a heal assign might help) plus he drops aggro when he does this so have the tank taunt or OT.
* He also has a fear (tremors plz), whirlwind (Melee out), and a cleave (face away from melee).
* If some1 dies they will get rezzed but after three people he levels up and does more dmg and takes less.
* Now head to the second optional boss (on the east), in the edge of madness and watch out for Mad servants (imps) when they die they spawn two  Blueberries. Four different bosses can only be summoned with mojo madness.
* Wushoolay spawns lightning clouds to stay out of and casts chain lightning so tank away from raid.
* Hazza’rah has an AoE mana burn atk that can be prevented by mana burning him. He will also spawn illusions that need to be killed. He has an AoE sleep that can be out ranged but everyone else needs dispell ot tremor totem.
* Gri’Lek Sword and board…. That’s it..
* Rena’taki will vanish and attempt to Lolstep ppl but can be brought out of it by AoE.  
- Make your way just north of the edge of madness to get to next boss.


## Thekal
* Tank all three bosses away from one another. Lor’Khan heals so shut that shit up. Zath will blind and gauge. All bosses can be disarmed! They all must die at the same time so try to coordinate that! Best case, get the to 10% bring them together and AoE them down. Remember tigers will spawn during this!
* Phase two bring him to entrance due to force puch knock back and blast him down fast while the second tank watches for pick up off of punch.
Ghaz (optional)
* If you can get the tape out of tackle, turn in and catch a bunch of the fish you can summon him. Prior to summon, clear out fish and fight him under water so his knock up is useless. Then tank and spank.


## High Priestess Arlokk
* Hit gong and the games begin with her spawning in the middle of the room. She will gouge the tank so a second tank will be needed to taunt off as add non-elite panthers will spawn. You can kill them as she will mark some1 for them to attack or kite them. When she disappears you can kill them down but all clothies, lether and casters stand with your back to the gate because she will jump on a rando.
* Make your way to the northeast, clear out the whole room before fighting the next boss.


## Jin’do
* He has a mind control totem and healing totems, focus them down each time they spawn.
* He will randomly tele a raid member into the blood pool full of skeles get out of pit and have a mage or warlock watch the pit to constantly aoe the skeles down.
* He will also hex the tank so dispell unless you have Mooscles or Taco.
* Whoever has delusions of Jin’do **(DO NOT DECURSE THIS!!)** is on shade watch and needs to kill them.


## Hakkar
* Watch for blood siphon, get a son of Hakkar pulled to raid, kill it and dance in poop for the nasty blood (do this b4 the call) and he will take dmg and not heal. 
* Watch for corrupted blood (COVID-19’s precusor) and for his mind control and insanity (you deal more4 dmg dough).
* At 10% he’ll enrage and burn he ass.
